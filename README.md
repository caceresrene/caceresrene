## Hi 👋🏽

I'm a Software Engineer at [Forpay](https://cl.forpay.cl/), a fintech that does recurrent payments and subscriptions.

In my free time, I collaborate on open-source projects at [Open Source USACH](https://github.com/open-source-usach), and I help the development team at [Tharsis](https://www.infobae.com/america/peru/2022/10/23/un-auto-espacial-disenado-en-la-uni-sorprende-a-la-nasa-esta-entre-los-mejores-del-mundo/), the project that will represent the National University of Engineering (Peru) in the NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge.

Previously I built interfaces for open-source tools used in state transparency and investigative journalism at the [America Transparente Foundation](https://americatransparente.org/), and I worked at a small consultancy company doing full-stack development.

I code in `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `React` and `Tailwind CSS`

I'm currently learning `Hono.js` and `Cloudflare Workers`, and I'd like to learn `Julia` in the future!
