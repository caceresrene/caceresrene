## 👋🏽 ¡Hola! I'm web developer based in Santiago, Chile.

I've recently graduated from a 14-week intensive coding boot camp, where I learned 	**full stack web development**. I've also completed one year of coursework in **Computer Science** at the University of Santiago, Chile.

I'm currently looking for my first opportunity in the industry, be it an internship, part-time or full-time position.
