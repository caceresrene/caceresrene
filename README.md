### ¡Hola! 👋🏽

I'm René Cáceres, a Computer Science Student @ University of Santiago, Chile.

I'm currently learning **React** and **Tailwind** trying to become a web developer and get a full time job some time soon :^) 
I post my progress almost daily at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/byebyerene)
